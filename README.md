# Data-Visualization
Data Visualization is the graphical representation of data/information by using graphs, plots, charts, maps and animations.

I have used plotly for interactive data visualization in python. 

**Why Plotly**

1. Plotly has hover tool capabilities that allows us to detect any outliers in the data.

2. It provides visually attractive and customized plots.

**Installation**

Terminal command:

                        pip install plotly

## Data
Data can be accessed from **"spotify_data.csv"** file

Here are few example codes of such representations in this repository.

## Line Chart 

 Line chart Displays a series of numerical data as points which are connected by lines.

 Code is available at **"Line_chart.ipynb"** file.

## Bar Chart

In a bar chart the data categories are displayed on the vertical axis and the data values are displayed on the horizontal axis.

Code is available at **"Bar_chart.ipynb"** file.

## 3D Chart
A bubble chart helps to display multiple bubbles in a 3d dimensional plot as same in 3d scatter plot. A bubble chart is primarily used to depict and show relationships between numeric variables.

Code is available at **"3D_chart.ipynb"** file.

## Interactive Plot
I have introduced dropdown and rageslider functionalities in this plot to make the plot more interactive.

Code is available at **"interactive_menus.ipynb"** file.
